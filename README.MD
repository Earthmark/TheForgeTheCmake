# The Forge The CMake
A set of CMake files for The Forge's (formerly ConfettiFX) fantastic minimalistic rendering engine, The Forge.

# Current Status
Still experimental.  I'm mostly modifying this for my own purposes.  PRs are certainly welcome though.

# Future Plans
Probably just update every now and then with The Forge releases.  Maybe I'll add the examples and unit tests?  We'll see.

# License
Expect WTFPL for the CMake files themselves: http://www.wtfpl.net/

I don't usually care for heavy or viral license.  Just know I do this in my free time between projects, so expect no warranty, support, and so on.
